                Head trainer, Michelle Charboneau, CPDT-KA, has a BA in Psychology and a Masters of Business Administration from the University of Missouri.
                She has been training dogs since 2009 when she began volunteering at an animal shelter.

                While working at the shelter, she was frustrated to discover that dogs adopted out as adorable puppies were often returned as out-of-control adults
                for "bad" behavior.  The behavior was typically due to nothing more than a lack of training.

                In 2010, Michelle completed the Assistant Trainers course offered by the Greater Saint Louis Training Club, and learned that positive reinforcement training
                is really about encouraging communication between pets and their people rather the obedience.  In 2013, Michelle completed the Karen Pryor Academy Dog Trainer Program.
