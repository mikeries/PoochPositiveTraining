        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="mission">
            To reduce the number of dogs surrendered or returned to animal shelters because of behavior problems, by teaching them good behavior, using only positive reinforcement and force-free training techniques.

            <h2>What <em>is</em> Clicker Training?</h2>
            <p>
                Clicker training relies on positive reinforcement rather than punishment. The desired behavior is reinforced with something the dog likes.
                The click simply tells the dog, "Yes..that's what I am looking for!" The click is a sound like no other in the dog's daily experience. The click is always followed by the reward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the desired behavior is learned, we fade the clicker and replace treats with real-life rewards!

            <h2>Why Clicker Training?</h2>
            <p>
                Because it works! We don't use aversive techniques or punishment at Pooch Positive, because we don't have to. Clicker training is based on scientifically-proven
                principles of behavioral psychology, including operant and classical conditioning. Simply, dogs repeat behaviors that are rewarded, and cease behaviors that are not.
                We do not have to shock, prong, or choke to get our dogs to engage in appropriate behavior. All we need to do is reward, praise, pet, play and LOVE them.
